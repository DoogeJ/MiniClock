# Introduction
For a while I wanted a nice small clock on my desk that would tell me both the date and time.

Now the specific code for this project is only ready-for-use if you (like me) live in the Netherlands (or the same timezone); and don't ever plan on changing your wifi password.
For anyone else, consider it a starting point for a project like this. I hope you find it useful.

# Remarks and potential improvements
* I found out on mine that the lid was a little too big. I have corrected the STL file for that, but not checked if it is actually okay now. Please let me know if you have issues with it.
* If you want to go the extra mile (be less lazy than me) and include a button and a [CH340](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32816118069.html) you can keep it programmable.
* You can also implement OTA updates by making some minor changes to the code: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-ota-updates-with-arduino-ide-over-the-air/
* I used a 3D pen to mount all the parts inside the enclosure. A hot glue gun will work just as fine.
